              My name is Abdullah Alazzani. I am currently a rising junior computer science student at Brooklyn College. I am presently accruing 200+ hours of hands-on professional training as part of a one-year career development program called Year-Up that included six months of college-level courses followed by a six-month internship. I spend most of my time on programming and learning new technologies. I am genuinely a self-learner who likes to take challenges and excel in his programming skills. For example, I have learned Python by completing online courses on Edx.org, Udemy, and Codecademy. Now, I am looking for Internships as a Software Developer to keep learning and challenging myself.
